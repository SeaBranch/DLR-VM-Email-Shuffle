## Git flow
some guidelines while contributing,
1: master is whatever is considered finished and in use 
2: develop is the approved work in progress that has been checked for quality prior to commit
3: for any new feature you may think to add to this project, create a branch off of develop starting with the text "feature/" in its title. When you feel that branch is ready to be added to develop, create a pr against develop for that branch. When a separate contributor has reviewed your code and approves, you may merge it with develop

from time to time @SeaBranch will create a release from develop and merge it with master, this will then be considered the "current" version of the project for general use
